# Solar-Tracking-System
The world population is increasing day by day and the demand for energy is increasing accordingly. Oil and coal, the main source of energy nowadays, are expected to end up from the world during the recent century which explores a serious problem in providing the humanity with an affordable and reliable source of energy. The need of the hour is renewable energy resources with cheap running costs. Solar energy has become a preferred because of its ubiquity, abundance and sustainability, regardless the intermittency of sunlight, solar energy is widely available and completely free of cost. It is harnessed (converted to other forms of energy) by using techniques such as solar heating photovoltaic cell, solar thermal energy, solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis. Photovoltaic is solid-state device that simply makes electricity out of sunlight, silently and with little to no maintenance, no pollution and no significant depletion of material resources. However, it is costly to install but in a long term it can save more energy and offers more reduction in cost. Solar panels, also called photovoltaic or PV module as it directly converts sunlight into electricity. A photovoltaic module is an interconnected collection of cells combined into one item. When a number of solar or photovoltaic modules are installed together, this is commonly referred to as a solar array. Many schemes have been developed to incorporate the same. The most widely renowned till date are:\
a. Static Solar Panel Systems\
b. Time based Moving Solar Panel Systems \
c. Maximum Power Point Tracking Solar Panel Systems. \
We will be looking into " Maximum Power Point Tracking Solar Panel Systems" in this project.\
Solar tracker is an electro-mechanical device for orienting a solar
photovoltaic panel toward the sun to get maximum intensity of light and to keep the position of panel perpendicular to the light source. Solar powered equipment works best when pointed at or near the sun, so a solar tracker can increase the effectiveness of such equipment. The tracker will enable the panel to follow the path of the sun and produce more power as it absorbs more
sunlight. In single axis solar tracking, tracker can only capture the minimum power tracking
sunlight in one direction which is the elevation movements from east to west by rotating the
structure along the vertical axis.\\
In this project we have used PIC16F877A with bi directional stepper motor inorder to make the solar tacker.
